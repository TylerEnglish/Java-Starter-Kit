## A Brief History of Java

Java, pioneered by Sun Microsystems (later acquired by Oracle), debuted in the mid-1990s. With the visionary James Gosling at the helm, Java emerged with the motto "Write Once, Run Anywhere", underscoring its cross-platform capabilities. Over time, Java has anchored itself in enterprise applications, Android mobile apps, and numerous other software ecosystems.
